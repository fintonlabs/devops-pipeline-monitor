cd ci-cd-monitoring-tool
```

3. **Install the required Python libraries**:

```bash
pip install flask flask_restful
```

## Verification Steps

After the installation, verify that everything is set up correctly:

1. **Check Python and Pip versions**:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

You should see Python version 3.6 or higher, and Pip version 19.0 or higher.

2. **Check Flask and Flask-RESTful installations**:

```python
python -c "import flask; print(flask.__version__)"
python -c "import flask_restful; print(flask_restful.__version__)"
```

You should see the versions of Flask and Flask-RESTful outputted without any errors.

3. **Run the project**:

```bash
python app.py
```

You should see a message stating that the server is running and listening on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Post-Installation Configuration

After successful installation, you may need to add your pipelines to the tool:

1. **Adding a pipeline**:

   Send a PUT request to `http://localhost:5000/pipeline/<id>` with the pipeline configuration in the request body.

2. **Removing a pipeline**:

   Send a DELETE request to `http://localhost:5000/pipeline/<id>`.

3. **Viewing a pipeline**:

   Send a GET request to `http://localhost:5000/pipeline/<id>`.

Remember to replace `<id>` with the ID of your pipeline.

That's it! You've successfully installed and configured the CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring Tool. Now you can start monitoring your pipelines, tracking build times and failures, and receiving alerts via the dashboard.

# Project Documentation: CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring Tool

This tool is designed to monitor CI/CD pipelines, track build times and failures, and provide alerts via a dashboard.

## Usage Guide

This guide will walk you through the basic and advanced usage of this tool, including common use cases, parameters, and examples of expected output.

### Basic Usage

The project revolves around two primary classes, `Pipeline` and `Pipelines`. The `Pipeline` class allows you to fetch, update, or delete a specific pipeline, while `Pipelines` is used to manage the collection of all pipelines.

Here is a basic example:

```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_restful import Api

app = Flask(__name__)
api = Api(app)

api.add_resource(Pipeline, '/pipeline/<int:id>')
```

In the above code block, we're adding a `Pipeline` resource to our Flask-RESTful Api instance. This resource can be accessed via the '/pipeline/' endpoint, with the specific pipeline id passed in the URL.


#### Command-line Arguments or Parameters

The `Pipeline` class has three primary methods:

1. `get(self, id: int)` - This method fetches the details of a specific pipeline. The `id` parameter is required to identify the pipeline.

2. `put(self, id: int)` - This method updates the configuration of a specific pipeline. The `id` parameter is required to identify the pipeline.

3. `delete(self, id: int)` - This method stops monitoring a specific pipeline. The `id` parameter is required to identify the pipeline.


### Expected Output Examples

Here are some examples of expected outputs:

1. Fetching a pipeline that doesn't exist:

```python
response = api.get('/pipeline/1')
print(response.data)
```

Output:

```json
{
  "error": "Pipeline not found"
}
```

2. Updating a pipeline:

```python
response = api.put('/pipeline/1', data={'name': 'New Pipeline'})
print(response.data)
```

Output:

```json
{
  "name": "New Pipeline"
}
```

3. Deleting a pipeline:

```python
response = api.delete('/pipeline/1')
print(response.data)
```

Output:

```json
{
  "result": "Pipeline deleted"
}
```


### Advanced Usage Scenarios

For advanced usage, you could extend the `Pipeline` and `Pipelines` classes to include more functionality. For instance, you could add a method to the `Pipeline` class that tracks the build times and failures, and another method to the `Pipelines` class that provides a summary of all pipelines.

For example:

```python
class Pipeline(Resource):
    # Existing methods...

    def track(self, id: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Track the build times and failures of a specific pipeline."""
        # Implementation...
```

This project provides the skeleton for a powerful CI/CD pipeline monitoring tool. By extending the functionality, you can customize the tool to suit your specific needs.
